# Hidden Markov Model Implementation
To quickly view the result, type:
    make

The model correctly predicts 48.5% of the states.

# To check the details of each python file:
1. run gen_matrix.py to generate transition matrix and emission matrix
   "python3 gen_matrix.py <train.dat> <E/T> <optional_factor>"
   please redirect the output into a file.

2. run hmm_viterbi.py to generate predications (please redirect output into file)
   "python3 hmm_viterbi.py <tm_matrix_file> <em_matrix_file> <testfile>"

3. run compare_result.py to compare the predicted result and the original result
   "python3 compare_result.py <test_file> <predict_file>"

4. there are several small test data file for testing purposes:
    test1.dat test2.dat test3.dat

    they are generated purely for verifying the correctness of the algorithm implementation.
